# User Guide

## Introduction

PlaNUS is a Command Line Interface (CLI) desktop app for students majoring under the Faculty of Engineering in NUS.
It serves as a centralized platform for our target user to manage their past, current, and future courses.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed.
2. Download the latest version of `PlaNUS.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-W12-1/tp/releases).
3. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar PlaNUS.jar`
   command to run the application.
4. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it.

## Features 

> Notes about the command format:
> - Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
e.g. in `add course COURSE_CODE`, `COURSE_CODE` is a parameter which can be used as `add course CFG2101`.
> - Items in curly braces are optional.
e.g. `view {y/YEAR} {t/TERM}` can be used as `view` or `view y/1`.
