## Design & implementation
{Describe the design and implementation of the product. Use UML diagrams and short code snippets where applicable.}

### Save feature

The save feature is facilitated by `FileSave`. It makes calls to the subclasses `Accommodation`, `Food` and `Landmark`
which are subclasses of the `TravelActivity` class to add each activity saved in the text file.

`addTravelActivity` is called everytime there is a valid-stored data in the text file that is read to upload the
activity back into the array list.

The Sequence Diagram below shows how the save file feature is being implemented when the user re-enters the chatbot
after using the bye command.

The above sequence diagram shows how existing save text files will be reloaded back into Omnibots array list to act as
a form of save feature when the user exits the bot. 


#[Proposed] Update feature

Proposed Implementation

The proposed update feature is mainly carried out by `TravelActivityList`. It stores objects with class `TravelActivity`in an array called `travelActivities`
and each `TravelActivity` class object contains a date and duration. The `TravelAcivityList` also contains the following method:
* `TravelActivityList#updateTravelActivity(travelActivityNumber, date, duration)`-- Updates the date and duration of the specified object of `TravelActivity` class type.

Step 1. When the user launches the app for the first time, there will be no objects of type `TravelActivity` in `travelActivities`.
Thus any attempts to call the command `update INDEX`
will result in an output telling the user that no travel activity can be found.

Step 2. After the user has added new travel activities into the `travelActivityList`, the user can execute
`update 1 /date 2020-12-20 /duration 2hours` command to update the date and duration of the first travel activity
in the travel activity list. The `update` command calls the `Parser#updateCommand(line, list)` which then calls the `TravelActivityList#updateTravelActivity(travelActivityNumber, date, duration)`
. 

Step 3. The method will then find the travel activity with the corresponding travel activity number in the `travelActivities` and then set the new date and duration
of that travel activity.

The sequence diagram below shows how an update operation goes through the parser component:
