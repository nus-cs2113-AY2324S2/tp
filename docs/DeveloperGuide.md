### UI and I/O

### Commands

### Storage

<ins>Overview</ins>

The StorageHandler class is responsible for managing the loading and saving of data regarding members and transactions from and onto the local machine. Each group calls its own StorageHandler object such that they maintain distinct storage directories.

<ins>Implementation Details</ins>

*Data Storage:*

Each `StorageHandler` instance creates `members.txt` and `transactions.txt` in their respective folders. The file format is as follows.

* `members.txt` - NAME | BALANCE
* `transactions.txt` - LENDER NAME | BORROWER1 NAME | AMOUNT1 | BORROWER2 NAME...

<ins>Class Structure</ins>

The StorageHandler has the following attributes:

* *storageFolderPath*: A string containing the path to the storage directory specific to the group.
* *storageMembersFilePath*: A string containing the path to the `members.txt` directory associated with the group.
* *storageTransactionsFilePath*: A string containing the path to the `transactions.txt` directory associated with the group.
* *membersFile*: A File object representing the `members.txt` file associated with the group.
* *transactionsFile*: A File object representing the `transactions.txt` file associated with the group.
* *members*: A MemberList object representing the list of Members in the group.
* *transactions*: A TransactionList object representing the list of Transactions in the group.
* *scanners*: A size 2 array of Scanners to be used for loading data from the data storage files. The first Scanner in the array is used for reading from `members.txt` while the second is used for reading from `transactions.txt`.

<ins>Constructor</ins>

The StorageHandler constructor creates the relevant data storage directories if they do not current exist while initializing the attributes of the object.

Key arguments for the constructor are a `MemberList` object, a `TransactionList` object and a string `groupName`. The first two are used to represent the list of `Member` objects and the list of `Transaction` objects associated with the group for reference when loading or saving data. The last represents the directory to be written to to ensure that data across groups are kept discrete.

<ins>Methods</ins>

* *loadMembersData*: Reads data from `membersFile` and unpacks it before inserting `Member` objects into `MemberList`.
* *loadTransactionsData*: Reads data from `transactionsFile` and unpacks it, checking if each member exists in `MemberList` before inserting `Transaction` objects into `TransactionList`.
* *saveMembersData*: Writes packaged data from each `Member` and saves it as a record in `membersFile`.
* *saveTransactionsData*: Writes packaged data from each `Transaction` and saves it as a record in `transactionsFile`.
  
Data loading methods are merged in the *loadAllData* method while data saving methods are merged in the *saveAllData* method.

<ins>Usage Example</ins>
![StorageHandler Sequence Diagram](diagrams/StorageHandler%20Sequence%20Diagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how StorageHandler behaves at each step:

1. The user launches the application for the first time. Group is initialized, creating an instance of StorageHandler. StorageHandler creates relevant storage directories if they do not yet exist.
2. StorageHandler reads data from the 2 data storage files and creates Member and Transaction objects in the associated utility list objects.
3. When a command which would alter the data within MemberList or TransactionList is invoked, the method to save data to the storage files is called by Group. This updates the information within the storage files.

<ins>Design Considerations</ins>

* Update upon change, not upon exit - This allows for data to be saved even if the application exits ungracefully.
* *checkTransactions* - Methods are provided to have a quick check to ensure that data from data storage is not corrupted.

### Member and MemberList

### Transaction and TransactionList

### PIN

<ins> Overview </ins>

The PINHandler class is responsible for managing the creation, loading, authentication, and resetting of a
Personal Identification Number (PIN) used for authentication in the LongAh application. It uses SHA-256 hashing to
securely store and compare PINs. The PINHandler class interacts with the StorageHandler class to save and load the PIN 
and authentication status.

Note: PIN is enabled by default and needs to be set upon first startup.

<ins>Implementation Details </ins>

*Data Storage:*

The PIN and authentication enabled status are saved in a file located at ./data/pin.txt.
The file format is as follows:

`hashed PIN`<br />
`authenticationEnabled`<br />

<ins> Class Structure </ins>

The PINHandler class has the following static fields:


- *PIN_FILE_PATH*: The path to the file where the PIN and authentication status are saved.

- *savedPin*: The hashed PIN saved in the file.

- *authenticationEnabled*: A boolean flag indicating whether authentication is enabled.

<ins> Constructor </ins>

The PINHandler constructor initializes the savedPin and authenticationEnabled fields by loading them from the file using
the loadPinAndAuthenticationEnabled method.

If the file does not exist or the savedPin is empty, it calls the createPin method to create a new PIN.

<ins> Methods </ins>

- *loadPinAndAuthenticationEnabled*: Loads the saved PIN and authentication enabled status from the file.

- *savePinAndAuthenticationEnabled*: Saves the PIN and authentication enabled status to the file.

- *getPinFilePath*: Returns the file path of the PIN file.

- *createPin*: Prompts the user to create a new 6-digit PIN and hashes it before saving.

- *authenticate*: Authenticates the user by comparing the entered PIN with the saved PIN.

- *resetPin*: Resets the PIN for the user by prompting for the current PIN and creating a new PIN if the current
PIN is correct.

- *enablePin*: Enables authentication upon startup.

- *disablePin*: Disables authentication upon startup.

- *getSavedPin*: Returns the saved PIN.

- *getAuthenticationStatus*: Returns the authentication status.

<ins> Usage Example </ins>

![pinhandler longah.png](diagrams%2Fpinhandler%20longah.png)


Given below is an example usage scenario and how the PIN creation and authentication mechanism behaves at each step:

1. The user launches the application for the first time. The PINHandler initializes, loading the saved PIN and 
authentication enabled status from the file. If no PIN exists, it prompts the user to create a new PIN.

2. The user creates a new 6-digit PIN using the createPin method. The entered PIN is hashed using SHA-256 before 
saving it to the file.

3. The user closes the application and relaunches it. The PINHandler loads the saved PIN and authentication 
enabled status from the file again.

4. The user attempts to log in by entering their PIN. The authenticate method hashes the entered PIN and 
compares it with the saved hashed PIN. If they match, the user is successfully authenticated.

5. The user decides to reset their PIN by entering their current PIN and creating a new one using the resetPin 
method.

6. The user disables authentication upon startup using the 'pin disable' command. The authenticationEnabled flag 
is set to false and saved to the file.

7. The user relaunches the application, and authentication is no longer required since it has been disabled. 
The user can proceed with the application and do any actions without entering a PIN.

Code Snippet
```
// Initialize PINHandler
PINHandler pinHandler = new PINHandler();

// Check if authentication is enabled
if (PINHandler.getAuthenticationStatus()) {
// Authenticate user
PINHandler.authenticate();
} else {
// Authentication is disabled, proceed with application logic
}
```

<ins> Design Considerations </ins>

Resetting PIN: The resetPin() method allows users to change their PIN by first verifying their current PIN. This adds 
an extra layer of security to prevent unauthorized PIN changes.

Authentication Management: Users have the option to enable or disable authentication upon startup using the 'pin enable'
and 'pin disable' commands. This flexibility allows users to customize their authentication preferences based on their 
security needs and convenience.

### Exceptions and Logging

<ins>Overview</ins>

This project makes used of centralised exception handling and logging means, allowing for greater standardisation throughout the codebase. This is done through the LongAhException class and Logging class respectively.

<ins>Implementation Details</ins>

The LongAhException class makes use of enumerations `ExceptionMessage` and `ExceptionType` to dictate its behaviour. `ExceptionMessage` stores the desired output message for each kind of potential error along with its associated `ExceptionType`. `ExceptionType` is used to define the manner in which the exception is logged.

Note: All exception calls are logged by default, either as WARNING or INFO depending on the `ExceptionType` classification tagged to the `ExceptionMessage`.

<ins>Class Structure</ins>

The LongAhException class has the following static field:
* *type*: A ExceptionType enumeration denoting how the exception should be logged.

The Logging class has the following static field:
* *longAhLogger*: A Logger type object to perform the logging.

<ins>Constructor</ins>

The LongAhException class calls the Exception constructor using the message associated with the received ExceptionMessage and stores the type of exception.

The Logging class initializes a file directory to store logging data.

<ins>Methods</ins>

The LongAhException class has the following key methods:

* *printException*: Prints the desired output message when an exception is thrown.

The Logging class has the following key methods:

* *logInfo*: Takes a string `message` as an argument. Create a log at the INFO level.
* *logWarning*: Takes a string `message` as an argument. Create a log at the WARNING level.

<ins>Usage Example</ins>

Use of the LongAhException class is demonstrated below, including throwing of an exception and printing the desired output message. This example covers the throwing exception due to invalid index.
```
import longah.exception.LongAhException;
import longah.exception.ExceptionMessage;

// Throw an exception
throw new LongAhException(ExceptionMessage.INVALID_INDEX);

// Catch exception and output desired message
catch (LongAhException e) {
    LongAhException.printException(e);
}
```

Logging can be performed using the following lines of code:
```
import longah.handler.Logging;

// Create log of INFO Level
Logging.logInfo(message);

// Create log of WARNING Level
Logging.logWarning(message);
```

## Non-Functional Requirements

* Technical Requirements: Any mainstream OS, i.e. Windows, MacOS or Linux, with Java 11 installed. Instructions for downloading Java 11 can be found [here](https://www.oracle.com/sg/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html).
* Project Scope Constraints: The application should only be used for tracking. It is not meant to be involved in any form of monetary transaction.
* Project Scope Constraints: Data storage is only to be performed locally.
* Quality Requirements: The application should be able to be used effectively by a novice with little experience with CLIs.

## Glossary

* Lender - Member making payments on behalf of other members.
* Borrower - Members being paid for by the lender.
* Transaction - Payment made by ONE Lender on behalf of MULTIPLE Borrower, represented as a list of Subtransaction.
* Subtransaction - Subset of Transaction, consists of ONE Lender and ONE Borrower.
* Group - Discrete units each containing their respective lists of Member and Transaction.
* Separator - "|" has been used to denote separator within this document but within the Storage related classes, the ASCII Unit Separator as denoted by ASCII 31 is used instead. This is defined within `StorageHandler`.

## Instructions for manual testing

View the [User Guide](UserGuide.md) for the full list of UI commands and their related use case and expected outcomes.

## Instructions for JUnit Testing

JUnit tests are written in the [`test directory`](../src/test/java/longah/) and serve to test key methods part of the application.

## Instructions for text-ui-testing

Files relating to Text UI Testing can be found [here](../text-ui-test/).

When running tests on a Windows system, run the following command from the specificied directory:
```
./runtest.bat
```

When running tests on a UNIX-based system, run the following command from the specified directory:
```
./runtest.sh
```

Warning: Text UI Testing has been configured to clear all past data records to simulate a fresh application starting when the above commands are invoked. This WILL result in loss of data from previous runs.

## Future Enhancements

1. Inclusion of anomaly detection algorithms to flag out potentially erroneous transactions.
2. Adding of further details tagged to each transaction and allow for searching of transactions based on these details.
3. Create a reminder system to inform users of upcoming events or to warn them to settle payments.
