## Design & implementation

### Save timetable function
The saving timetable mechanism is facilitated by the Storage class. It implements the following operations: 
* `Storgae#createFolder()`: Creates a folder in the directory where all the users' timetable will be stored in the local computer.
* `Storage#addExistingUsers()`: Loops through the folder to add all previous saved users upon opening the app, as well as their corresponding tasks.
* `Storage#addUserInFolder(User user)`: When a new user is added, a file with the name of the user will be created in the folder.
* `Storage#writeTaskInFile(User user)`: when a new task of a specific user is added, it will be written into the correct file.

The following sequence diagram shows how the operations in the Storage class goes through when the app is opened and it loads data from history:

## User Stories

|Version| As a ... | I want to ... | So that I can ...                                           |
|--------|----------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
|v1.0| new user |see usage instructions| refer to them when I forget how to use the application      |
|v2.0| user     |find a to-do item by name| locate a to-do without having to go through the entire list |
|    | user     |add a task to the timetable| record when a task needs to be done  |

## Parser Component

Here is a general guide of how Parse Class looks like in sequence diagram.

![Parse.png](diagram%2FParse.png)

Here is a class diagram for the method changeTaskTiming method in Parser Class.

The following sequence diagram of changeTaskTiming shows the interactions with other objects.

![changeTaskTiming_Sequence_Diagram.png](diagram%2FchangeTaskTiming_Sequence_Diagram.png)

Here is how this method works:

1. The Parser calls the changeTaskTiming method with a command and the UserList. It calls InputValidator.

2. The InputValidator validates the command, ensuring that it meets the required format in days and index.

3. If validation is successful, the User calls the timetable and calls its changeFlexibleTaskTiming method with the specified parameters.

4. The Timetable updates the timing of the flexible task.

5. If successful, the InputValidator sends a success message back to the Parser. Otherwise, it throws a RuntimeException.

## Timetable Component
Here is a sequence diagram of changeTaskType method in Timetable class. It shows the interactions with other objects.
![changeTaskType.png](diagram%2FchangeTaskType.png)

Here is how this method works:
1. The sequence starts with the Parser sending a request to the Timetable to change the type of a task.

2. The Timetable activates and processes the changeTaskType method.

3. Within the Timetable, the dayOfWeek parameter is capitalized to ensure consistency.

4. The Timetable calls the list of tasks associated with the specified day (dayOfWeek). It activates the Task object to fetch the task at the specified index (index).

5. The Task object modifies the type of the task to the new type specified by the Parser.

6. Finally, the modified task or any relevant status information is returned to the Parser.
