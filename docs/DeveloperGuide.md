## Design & implementation

{Describe the design and implementation of the product. Use UML diagrams and short code snippets where applicable.}

The Voyagers application is designed as a command-line interface 
(CLI) tool for managing travel trips. 
It is implemented in Java and follows a modular architecture to promote scalability and maintainability.


### Normal flow of the application

The application starts by displaying a welcome message. Then the flow is as follows:

1. The user is prompted to enter a command.
2. The application processes the command and displays the appropriate output.
3. Steps 1 and 2 are repeated until the user enters the `exit` command.

The implementation of this flow is made using four main classes: `Parser`, `Commands`, `Storage` and `Ui`.
With these classes we can encapsulate the whole logic of the application in a relative simple loop.

````java
                                    ...
  while (!isExit) {
            try {
                String fullCommand = ui.readCommand();
                Command c = NewParser.parse(fullCommand);
                c.execute(tripList, ui, null);
                isExit = c.isExit();

            } catch (Exception e) { 
                ui.echo(e.getMessage());
            }
                                ...
````

The following UML sequence diagram shows the flow of the application when the user enters a command.

### Settling a bill: minimizing number of transactions.

To be implemented.

## Setting Up, Getting Started

Run the JAR File, then follow the prompts through the command-line interface. Refer to this guide for syntax.

## Architecture

{UML Diagram of high-level app architecture}
Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

Voyagers {...}  
Parser {...}  
Commands {...}  
Storage {...}  
Ui {...}  
Trip {...}  
Bill {...}

## Bill
Bill implements Payable, an interface to be used a few times in this project to cover 
actions involving payment. It is dependent on the Profile and Trip classes, and Parser
is dependent on the Bill class. We will include this in the UML diagrams to be included soon.
Currently, the supported public methods can add and remove Profiles, pay the bill, change
percentages that different people owe, and set and return various attributes. This is still
not fully fleshed out, as we will add more features and better functionality in subsequent
releases.
